                Hi! Welcome to my page.
                My name is Mary Goldie Satinitigan. You can call me Goldie.
                I come from Cebu City the oldest city and first capital of the Philippines.

                Knitting has always been my go to activity. Although I have several hobbies, such as watching movies and series,making videos and DIY, knitting is what resonates well with me.
                <br>
                It was always a great dream of mine to travel in a foreign country. I would like to go to Japan because I'm a fan of anime.
                <br><br>
                I am a creative young woman. I have a good relationship to my brother and my parents. Sometimes there is a little quarrel but I think this is normal and we resolve the problem
                together.
                <br>
